# Multi-Objective Optimization of Heat Exchangers
This repository includes the code for the optimization of fan-assisted tube-fin heat exchangers via genetic algorithms. 

The code constains models for the propertiies of the internal and external fluids, characteristic areas and therma, hydraulic and aerodynamic correlations. The optimization is set as a mixed-interger problem to determine the design parameters of systems by the multi-objective optimization of the performance and power consumption of the component via genetic algorithms.
